```

### Database & Drizzle ORM Best Practices
- **Schema Management**: Always use Drizzle schema definitions in `./lib/db/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: Generate migrations with `npm run db:generate` after schema changes
- **Type Safety**: Use `createInsertSchema` and `createSelectSchema` from drizzle-zod
- **Relations**: Define proper relations for complex queries
- **Connection**: Use the configured database instance from `./lib/db/drizzle.ts`
- **Environment**: PostgreSQL runs on port 54321 locally via Docker Compose

```typescript
// Example schema pattern
export const tableName = pgTable('table_name', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  clerkUserId: text('clerk_user_id').notNull(), // Always reference Clerk users
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow().notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at').defaultNow().notNull(),
});

// Example query pattern
import { db } from '@/lib/db/drizzle';
const result = await db.select().from(tableName).where(eq(tableName.clerkUserId, userId));
```

### Clerk Authentication Integration
- **User Management**: All user references use `clerkUserId` (string)
- **Auth Patterns**: Use `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs` in Server Components
- **Client Auth**: Use `useUser()` hook in Client Components
- **Webhooks**: User sync handled via `/api/clerk/webhook` endpoint
- **Protected Routes**: Use Clerk's middleware for route protection
- **Database Sync**: Users synced to local database for complex queries

```typescript
// Server Component auth pattern
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
const { userId } = auth();
if (!userId) redirect('/sign-in');

// Client Component auth pattern
import { useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs';
const { user, isLoaded } = useUser();
```

### Polar Billing Integration
- **Products**: Configure PRO and BUSINESS tier product IDs in environment
- **Subscriptions**: Synced via webhooks to `userSubscriptions` table
- **Checkout**: Use Polar SDK for subscription management
- **Tiers**: 'free', 'pro', 'business' - stored in database
- **Webhooks**: Handle subscription changes via `/api/billing/webhook`
- **Cron Sync**: Automated subscription sync every 6 hours

```typescript
// Subscription check pattern
import { getUserSubscription } from '@/lib/billing';
const subscription = await getUserSubscription(userId);
const isPro = subscription?.tier === 'pro' || subscription?.tier === 'business';
```

### Component Architecture & UI Guidelines
- **Shadcn Components**: Use pre-installed components from `./components/ui`
- **Icons**: Always use Lucide React (`lucide-react` package)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn design tokens
- **Themes**: Dark/light mode support built-in
- **Layout**: Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- **Loading States**: Use Shadcn skeleton components for loading
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries

### State Management & Data Fetching
- **Global State**: Use Zustand for complex state management
- **Server State**: Use TanStack Query for API calls and caching
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Local State**: useState for component-specific state
- **Persistence**: Use Zustand persist middleware when needed

### File Upload & Storage (Vercel Blob)
- **Configuration**: Use `./lib/storage.ts` utilities
- **Image Patterns**: Support for profile images, document uploads
- **Validation**: Implement proper file type and size validation
- **Cleanup**: Handle file deletion when records are removed

### Email Integration (Resend)
- **Templates**: Create email templates in `./lib/email`
- **Transactional**: Welcome emails, billing notifications
- **Configuration**: Use environment variables for branding
- **Error Handling**: Proper fallbacks for email delivery

### Error Monitoring (Sentry)
- **Integration**: Auto-configured with Next.js
- **Performance**: Track Web Vitals and API performance
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement proper error boundaries
- **User Context**: Associate errors with user sessions

### Environment Configuration
- **Required Variables**: See `.env.example` for complete list
- **Local Setup**: Use Docker Compose for PostgreSQL
- **Production**: Vercel deployment with proper environment variables
- **Security**: Use `CRON_SECRET` for API route protection

### Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Always reference Clerk users via `clerkUserId` in database operations
- Use proper error handling for all external API calls (Clerk, Polar, Resend)

### TypeScript and Type Safety Guidelines
- Never use the `any` type - it defeats TypeScript's type checking
- For unknown data structures, use:
  - `unknown` for values that could be anything
  - `Record<string, unknown>` for objects with unknown properties
  - Create specific type definitions for metadata/details using recursive types
- For API responses and errors:
  - Define explicit interfaces for all response structures
  - Use discriminated unions for different response types
  - Create reusable types for common patterns (e.g., pagination, metadata)
- For Drizzle ORM:
  - Use generated types from schema definitions
  - Leverage `InferSelectModel` and `InferInsertModel` types
  - Create proper Zod schemas for validation

### Type Management and Organization
- **Centralized Types**: All shared types are organized by domain and functionality
  - `lib/types/user.ts` - User-related types extending schema types
  - `lib/types/billing.ts` - Billing and subscription types extending schema types
  - `lib/types/index.ts` - Re-exports all domain types for easy importing
  - `lib/api/` - API infrastructure types and utilities (errors, responses, etc.)
- **Type Hierarchy**: Always extend existing schema types rather than creating duplicate interfaces
  - Use `import type { User } from '@/lib/db/schema'` as base types
  - Create variants for different use cases (e.g., `UserWithSubscription`, `UserProfile`)
  - Prefer `Pick<>`, `Omit<>`, and intersection types over full redefinition
- **Import Patterns**: 
  - Use `import type { TypeName } from '@/lib/types'` for domain types (user, billing)
  - Use `import type { TypeName } from '@/lib/api'` for API infrastructure types
  - Import directly from schema only when using base types without extensions
  - Never duplicate type definitions across files
- **Type Naming**: Follow consistent naming conventions
  - Base types: `User`, `UserSubscription`, `Notification` (match schema exports)
  - Extended types: `UserWithSubscription`, `UserProfile`, `NotificationWithUser`
  - List types: `UserListItem`, `SubscriptionSummary`
  - Operation types: `CreateUserData`, `UpdateSubscriptionData`
  - Statistics: `UserStats`, `BillingStats`, `SubscriptionMetrics`
- **Component Props**: Define component-specific prop interfaces inline
  - Shadcn UI components already provide comprehensive typed interfaces
  - Create component-specific interfaces only when needed (e.g., `TechCardProps`)
  - Avoid over-abstracting UI component types unless there's clear reuse

### Performance Optimization
- Implement proper code splitting with Next.js dynamic imports
- Use React.memo for expensive computations
- Leverage TanStack Query's caching capabilities
- Use proper key props for lists
- Implement proper virtualization for long lists
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Use Sentry performance monitoring

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for utility functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Database operations and API routes
- **Mocking**: Proper mocks for Clerk, Polar, Resend APIs
- **Coverage**: Maintain good test coverage for critical paths
- **E2E**: Consider Playwright for critical user flows

### Security Best Practices
- **Authentication**: Always verify user sessions via Clerk
- **Authorization**: Check user permissions for data access
- **API Security**: Validate webhooks with proper secrets
- **Database**: Use parameterized queries (Drizzle handles this)
- **Environment**: Never commit secrets, use environment variables

### Deployment & Production
- **Platform**: Vercel with automatic deployments
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL (Neon, Supabase, or similar)
- **Environment**: Production environment variables properly configured
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking and performance
- **Cron Jobs**: Vercel Cron for subscription synchronization

### Color Rules
- Never use new colors, always use the ones defined in `./app/globals.css` file (following shadcn/ui theme)
- Use CSS variables for consistent theming across light/dark modes
